## Purpose
Successive model generations can reiterate similar, if not identical, phrases that would commonly be denoted as a tone violation. Based on a user input "word bank", HTML renders targeted words or phrases as highlighted to enable easier, faster identification of commonly-marked tone violations.

## How to install
1. Clone the repository in a new directory using ``git clone https://github.com/michaelpaglia/highlight-words.git``
2. Open ``chrome://extensions``, enable "Developer Mode", click on "Load Unpacked", and select the directory you created

## Notes
1. Recommended to set up before you enter a production queue, as adding/removing a word reloads the webpage
